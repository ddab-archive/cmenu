## Final Release

The final release of the component is [v1.2.0](https://github.com/ddab-archive/cmenu/releases/tag/v1.2.0-FINAL).

## Source Code

The component source code was never developed under any form of version control.

This repository is based on the source code of the final release along with the changes listed below. The source code as it was at the final release can be viewed by switching to the [`v1.2.0-FINAL`](https://github.com/ddab-archive/cmenu/tree/v1.2.0-FINAL) tag.

### Commits since final release

The `main` branch of this repository differs from the source code of the final release only in as much as this `README.md` was added for display by GitHub.

### Note about compiling the component help file.

`Help/PJColourPopupMenu.hap` contains the original source of the help file. This was compiled to an `.rtf` file by an obsolete program called _Help Topic Author_. The `.rtf` file was then compiled to the final WinHelp file using the Microsoft Help Compiler, _HCRTF_. However, since both the `.rtf` and compiled `.hlp` files are included in the repository, there is no need to recompile the help file from scratch. If changes are required then the `.rtf` file can be edited directly and then recompiled with _HCRTF_.
